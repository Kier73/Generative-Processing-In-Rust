# vMath Synthesis: vgpu_rust/src/vgeometric.rs

## 1. The 11 Atomic Primitives of Computation
**Lines 5-18**
- **Logic**: A complete basis for expressing any logical or mathematical transformation.
- **Basis Set**:
  - **ID** (Identity): $f(x) = x$
  - **CP** (Composition): $f \circ g$
  - **RC** (Recursion): Fixed-point fixed-entropy loops.
  - **CH** (Choice): Manifold branching/conditionals.
  - **RL** (Relation): Ordering and topological comparison.
  - **DY** (Duality): Inversion/Mirroring.
  - **AB** (Abstraction): Structural enclosure.
  - **PM** (Permutation): Algebraic reordering.
  - **AG** (Aggregation): Entropy reduction/Reduction.
  - **PR** (Projection): Sub-field selection.
  - **QM** (Quantum Mapping): Holographic superposition.
- **Virtual Layer Dynamics**: **Logical DNA**. These primitives form the fundamental "Genome" of the vGPU, allowing any external software logic to be decomposed into a canonical form for inference.

## 2. Universal Law Signatures (Recursive Hashing)
**Lines 61-88**
- **Logic**: Computing a topological fingerprint of a logic tree.
- **Math (LaTeX)**:
  Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a logic tree. The Law Signature $L$:
  \[ L = \text{Seed}_{prim} \oplus \text{Arity} \oplus \text{Fold}(\text{Signatures}_{children}) \]
  The folding operation uses a Feistel mix to preserve structural entropy.
- **Virtual Layer Dynamics**: **Structural Fingerprinting**. Identifying "Laws" (algorithms) by their shape rather than their implementation details.

## 3. Manifold Coordinate Binding ($M = L \oplus I$)
**Lines 90-95**
- **Logic**: Combining a Law ($L$) and an Input ($I$) to find a unique coordinate in the latent space.
- **Math (LaTeX)**:
  Manifold Coordinate $\mathbf{M}$:
  \[ \mathbf{M} = \text{Feistel}(L \oplus I, \sigma) \]
- **Virtual Layer Dynamics**: **The Great Synthesis**. This is the core equation of the vGPU. It maps an abstract "Question" (Law + Input) to a specific "Location" in the Latent Space. If the location contains a memoized result, the vGPU returns it in $O(1)$, effectively turning "Thinking" into "Looking."
